Welcome to FreeEMS-Parser!

This is a very simple program to parse a binary log file from FreeEMS and
output a CSV file that can be manipulated with other tools such as open office.

Build it with:

gcc src/FreeEMS-Parser.c

Run it with:

a.out <inputFile> > /dev/null

The output file will be in default.csv

Enjoy!
